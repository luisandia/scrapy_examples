These are certified and high grade American gold coins--a 1904    $20 Liberty (MS63 grade) and  a  1927 $20 St. Gaudens (MS64 grade). The coins are .9675 ounces of gold each. They are high quality coins and are NOT being sold for melt value. The coins are $1250 each. ,
,
I can meet in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, or Long Island. If you are interested, email me your phone number and the neighborhood where you would like to meet. ,
,
PLEASE, the prices are firm and I will ignore any lower offers (meaning, I won't answer emails that ask if I will take less or that offer less). If you don't think the prices are good, try ebay and find out. Ebay sales in the past two months show sales at between $1300 and $1350 for similar coins. If you just like to invest in gold bullion, these are not for you. If you want QUALITY gold coins at a reasonable price, here they are.

Folk art painting of boxer Felix Trinidad by outsider artist, actor, performer, painter, raconteur punk rock icon Tomatâ du Plenty real name --- David Xavier Harrigan (1948 - 2000). The piece has a great shape and a hook making it ready to hang. Tomatâ careened from careers as a theater troupe founder in the 1960s in San Francisco to lead singer of the experimental punk band The Screamers in the 1970s in LA to multi-media artist living in Miami, Seattle and New Orleans. His ashes are interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in a niche in the Chapel Columbarium.,
,
In 2012, noted scholar and art collector, Gordon W. Bailey, a champion of du Plenty's artistry, gifted a number of his superb portraits depicting boxers and entertainers to the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, GA in honor of the founding members of R.E.M., Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill Berry. Bailey encouraged the museum to pay tribute to du Plenty and following his lead the museum organized the exhibition Boxers and Backbeats: Tomata du Plenty and the West Coast Punk Scene which ran from October 2014 until January 2015.,

One Gear no Fear, that's what you tell all your friends when they ask you how many gears your bike has.
Our 6KU Fixie is all about the simplicity. How many gears does it have? One. You know what that means? You spend more time riding your fixed gear, then fixing your ride. It's steel frame and fork takes those rough roads and smooths them out like a Cadillac Coupe DeVille. You can set your fixie up as a single speed, or flip that rear wheel, and show off your whip skid skills. Whichever way you ride your fixie, you'll be enjoying every minute of it.,

Hello,,
,
I am selling a 125g fish tank with stand. The tank has no leaks or cracks. The tank is used so there are general signs of use, and slight scratches on the glass. Comes with a high quality wooden stand that was bought new, and also has general signs of use. Comes with 2 glass covers and one plastic cover. ,
,
Looking to sell the tank ASAP. I can't help with any movement of the tank or stand so please come prepared. Located in Queens Village, NY. ,
,
Also selling a 30g bowfront tank with stand, will combine both for discounts.

Purchases less than a year ago for $88 with delivery. ,

Hardware for securing to the wall is included. ,

Combine as many cabinets as you like and use the top surface to unload your wallet, cell phone or keys. It's shallow and takes up little space - a practical solution in smaller entrances or hallways.,

,
The shallow cabinet takes up little space, and is ideal for storing shoes, gloves and scarves.,
If your storage needs change you can easily create more storage space by stacking several cabinets on top of each other or placing them side by side. There is a recessed area on the top of the cabinet that you can use to place small things, like your keys, coins and mobile phone.,

These steel signs were made by world renown artist,
 ●KILLY KILFORD●,
they are individually numbered on the back,
,
He moved to nyc and ,
felt we needed a bit of cheering up, ,
and Voila!,
HAPPY SIGNS were born!,
 He put a very limited amount of  them,
 up on signposts around the city in Nov. 2013.,
,
Unfortunately,  the Dept. Of Transportation,
 did not quite agree, and proceeded,
 to take them all down.,
 They were quoted saying that ,
""due to the sudden proliferation of unauthorized signage"",
 the DOT was embarking on a ,
sweep of all city streets,
 to remove them.,
,
Lucky for you, I got there first.,
 I couldn't save them all, ,
but managed to snag a few, ,
which I am offering to you, here and now.,
The provenance of these artworks ,
is very well documented in the media,
And the artist has had larger commissions.,
 The city of Newark ordered,
 their own HAPPY SIGNS from the artist in 2014.,
,
These are the last ones I have.  ,
They are $125-$150 depending on the slogan. ,
A smart collector wlll buy them all at a great price.,

Electro-Voice Model 667A dynamic cardioid boom or stand-mounted broadcast microphone in excellent cosmetic and working condition. This mic is considered one of the world's best voice over microphones. This sale does not include the original shock mount or boom yoke, but does include a more compact Audio-Techica AT8415 shock mount and foam windscreen. It also works with a variety of other high end shock mounts, including the Rycote InVision Universal Microphone Shock Mount.,
,
This microphone, introduced in 1965, was designed for boom or stand mount­ing in broadcasting and recording. Not simply an improvisation on existing equipment, the 667A was created to overcome the problems encountered in boom applica­tions. It is a very high quality broadcast microphone and similar to Shure's venerable 5B. ,
,
This microphone was bought for and used the U.S. Senate campaign of Gov. Wendell Ford of Kentucky in 1974. It was used on Ford's filmed commercials and for endorsements by other politicians. Ford was elected to the U.S. Senate that year and went on to serve 24 years. ,
,
Unusually light in weight, the 667A is easily maneuverable. It fits nicely on standard boom or desk stands. Very low sensitivity to induced hum permits use close to lights and AC lines.,
,
An outstanding feature of the 667A is the self-contained computer-type programming board which permits a total of six different frequency response curves. The programming panel is part of a versatile passive equalizer which is completely self-contained; no external equip­ment or special connecting cables are required. ,
,
The variations from flat response, thus made available, permit the 667A to overcome acoustical problems and background noise, make pos­si­ble special effects, and enable its use mixed with existing microphones of differing responses.

Western Electric 639A Ribbon Microphone with various parts. The mic, introduced in 1938, has three pickup patterns -- non-directional, bi-directional and cardioid. The microphone itself is in excellent cosmetic and working condition and emits a strong audio signal. ,
,
The only missing part is the top of the mic's outer cage. This package includes a 639A mic, a side shell in like-new condition, a connection base with XLR end connector and an original cover pouch.,
,
The 639A's three pickup patterns -- C, D, and R -- are selectable through a three-position screwdriver-operated switch. At the angle of minimum response, the average discrimination with respect to zero degree response is 20 dB over the range from 40 to 10,000 cycles per second.,
,
The mic combines a dynamic moving coil pressure element and a ribbon velocity actuated element enclosed in a housing which serves as a protective guard and wind screen. The outputs of these two elements are used independ­ently, or are combined in various proportions by means of a selector switch attached to the micro­phone, to yield different directional patterns.,
,
The moving coil pressure element when used alone has non-directional character­istics. The ribbon element when used alone has a figure eight pattern. The combination of the two elements results in a phasing of the output voltage causing the micro­phone to have a cardioid directional pattern.,
,
Designed by the Bell Telephone Laboratories, this microphone was manu­factured by the Western Electric Company. Later models were manufactured by Altec. This model mic has been a staple of broadcasting for many years and is still is use throughout the world.  ,
,
The majority of all wide-range sound recording--from its initial appearance on motion picture sound­tracks to magnetic tape--have employed one or more 639A micro­phones in virtually all phases of production.,
,
The mic is excellent for studio use in broadcasting and recording. It was particularly suitable for multi-micro­phone pickups of a large orchestra where a sense of realism and an apparent increase of volume level was desired.,
,
The mic is 7.5-inches high, 4.7 inches long, 3.7 inches wide and weighs 3.5 pounds.

Altec-Lansing M-11B Microphone System in magnificent cosmetic, fully tested and excellent working condition. ,
,
This package includes an Altec-Lansing 150A base unit with 21B capsule, better known as the famous ""coke bottle"" mic, in like new pristine condition. Also includes special 8-pin cable and P519A rack-mount power supply. This microphone is in absolutely MINT condition.,
,
This microphone was rented for the singer Patti Page for the opening of a nightclub in Columbia, South Carolina in the 1950s. It was used for her performance and then pulled from service and kept in a box as new for many years.,
,
This mic is as clean as clean gets. You won't find a mic and head assembly in more perfect condition. If you are a collector, this is an excellent working example of one of the most famous microphones in the world.,
,
Here's the story of this legendary microphone. Altec-Lansing billed its M-11 microphone system as ""the mic that became a must!"" when it came out in March, 1949. It's capsule was amazingly small for mics in that era.,
,
This microphone was a revolutionary development at the time because condenser mics had fallen out of favor in the 1930s. Ribbon and dynamics had taken over professional audio and many thought the condenser would never come back. This was Altec's response at the time. It hit a home run.,
,
More than 20 ""man-years"" were spent on the design of the M-11 system. The result wasn't just a better microphone, but a microphone smaller in diameter than a dime that set a new standard in audio performance.,
,
Before the M-11, the condenser mikes of the 1920s and 30s were big and had bulky amplifiers that had to be in close proximity to the pickup capsule. They were powered by large battery packs. The new smaller size capsule mated with the new ""miniature"" vacuum tubes developed during WWII made possible the return of the condenser mic. ,
,
Altec used an A/C power supply box instead of bulky battery packs. The capsule itself was 5/8ths of an inch in diameter and just a quarter inch thick. It had a sound entrance opening that was a tiny slot around the top edge of the capsule.,
,
People referred to this mike as the ""coke bottle"" because of its unique and stylish shape. The small 21B capsule was mounted at the top of the slender coke bottle-shaped 150A base which contained a 6AU6 miniature vacuum tube which converted the very high impedance of the capsule to a low impedance by use of a cathode-follower circuit.  ,
,
The microphone used a multi-conductor cable connected through a Cannon ""P"" 8-pin connector which was at the bottom of the coke bottle. The mic could be separated from the power supply by as much as 400 feet. This cable mated with the power supply which supplied both filament and high voltage to the vacuum tube and condenser capsule.   ,
,
The rack-mount power supply box also has an output cable with an XLR connector that connects the system to the audio equipment it is to be used with.,
,
The 21B capsule produced an extremely smooth and extended response over the entire audio range and was omnidirectional. The M-11 microphone system became an instant sensation in the audio industry. It operates on the same level as the famous Neumann KM83, U63 or KM53. It is revered for drum rooms, piano, acoustic guitars, guitar amps and vocals. ,
,
It was the start of the resurgence of the condenser microphones in the United States that continues today.

The handbook takes readers through the research paper process step by step, and includes information on narrowing the topic, outlining, note taking, etc. Before dealing with such mechanics of writing as spelling, punctuation, and format, the manual covers the use of catalogs (online and paper), indexes, and databases in the library and offers a list of some standard print and electronic reference works. The sections on documentation in text and citations seem to include every type of source and possible variable. The work concludes with abbreviations for terms used in research, reference sources by subject, and some examples of other styles of documentation. Examples within each section are printed in a font different from the explanatory text, a feature that allows the user to easily find the appropriate format. Chapters are divided by subtopics with numeric denotation; an index makes topics easy to find.Provides guidelines and examples for handling research, outlining, spelling, punctuation, formatting, and documentation.

BatteryBox smart portable battery that powers select MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros and USB devices. It's used but still in good condition. I bought it for emergencies when I travel but hardly ever used it. It comes with all its original contents in the box. It runs BatteryOS and uses AI to efficiently power Macbooks and any USB-compatible devices without battery-life degradation. It can provide up to 14 hours of extra usage on the Macbook Air and up to 7.4 hours on a Macbooks Pro. It's only compatible with Macbooks made after mid-2012 with MagSafe 2 connector. The USB port can be used to charge most USB devices like iPhone, iPads, and even the 12"" MacBook. For pickup in Palisades Park, NJ area.,

This gorgeous, completely handmade dining set featuring a 6 foot table, six chairs and the option of two extensions for an additional fee (shown in the last photo). The top is solid ash and features breadboard ends with traditional mortise and tenon joinery that allows the wood to expand and contract with climate fluctuations. The table base is made with Douglas fir in our x-leg trestle style with a V shaped stretcher. The table measures 72"" x 36"" x 30"". The x-back chairs coordinate with the table with ash tops and Douglas fir bases. The chairs are also made with mortise and tenon joinery which provides stability. The stain on the ash has a custom aged russet tone which is very beautiful. The bases are finished in a deep ebony stain which allows the wood grain to peek through. It is a stunning combination.,

This will be made to order just for you. If you like this set but are looking for something a little different feel free to contact me for a custom quote! ,

A Classic since 1916,
When it comes to building with wood, Lincoln Logs is the name that stands alone as the very best. Lincoln Logs was invented in 1916 by John Lloyd Wright, the son of one of America's most famous architects, Frank Lloyd Wright. The idea of Lincoln Logs came to the younger Wright as he observed the building techniques used to construct the Imperial Palace Hotel in Tokyo. The product is named after Abraham Lincoln, the President who began his celebrated life in a log cabin in Kentucky.,
Real Wood Logs,
For over nine decades, Lincoln Logs has maintained its rustic look and reputation for quality and durability. Every log is still made with real wood, which is precision cut and placed in a tumbler to achieve a smooth, splinter-free finish. Logs are treated with a top-grade stain to help preserve and extend the life of the wood. ,
Nostalgia in a Box,
This Redwood Junction has the feel of an old-time western town and train station.,

Description:,
,
The Gubi Chair, designed by Komplot Design, was the first furniture design to be based on the innovative technique of molding three-dimensional veneer. The 3D design gives the chair comfort and a sense of lightness - with all edges pointing away from the user. The thickness of the veneer is reduced to half of that normally used due to the very strong 3D design. The Gubi Chair is included in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection.,
,
The inspiration of the Beetle Chair was found in the insect world as GamFratesi has been looking closely at the anatomy, aesthetics and movement of a beetle. The design of the chair reinterprets the characteristic elements of the beetles' sections: shape, shells, sutures, rigid outside and soft inside.,
,
This chair is in perfect condition, I am selling it because I am moving. ,

I have five (5) wire sculptures by Thai Varick, one of the most gifted of late 20th century New York's underground art world: a bull, horse, cat, whale and baseball player.  Made from a single coil of wire, each displays Thai's characteristic ""heart"" in the center of the work.  Please email me for dimensions.  Prices range are negotiable.   Included in each sale will be a New York Times article about Thai's work.  This sale is a rare opportunity to own an authentic piece of  American art, pieces that the Times and other critics compare to Calder.

This bed cost over $300 ($279 + tax) brand-new, but it's yours for only ***$179*** with me! It includes four large drawers under the bed, so you can store anything inside it (like bedding/linens).,
,
Only used in our guest room for one year, still in excellent condition. There's a small crack in the wood on one of the drawers, but it isn't noticeable from the outside and doesn't affect your ability to use the drawer/storage at all.,

We're just getting rid of this because we're turning the bedroom into a nursery (yes, baby on the way).,

Bock U 195 Microphone. Works great! Used lightly and carefully in a professional recording studio. This is a great, large diaphragm FET microphone. It is practically two mics in one, as it lets you select between fat and norm modes for bass response tailoring. There is also a low-cut switch as well as a pad (10 dB maybe?).  In pristine condition. Very versatile- can be used on vocals, bass guitar cabs, acoustic guitars and a plethora of other instruments.  Big, warm tone at a great price.  Comes with a carrying case.,
Shock mount is included.

Known worldwide for his botanic photographs, Beck focuses on still-life images. Some of his photographs refer explicitly to different moments of art history: Dutch paintings from the 17th century, through his large-scale tulips portraits, and Impressionist paintings from 19th century, with water lilies. In his Black and White series, he pays significant attention to picture grains, light effects, and contrasts to enhance the idea of nature imitating art. Beck always photographs flowers and plants frontally, and associates their Latin name with a nickname, which is the title of the artwork.,
,
,
Lawrence Beck (American, b.1962) is a botanic photographer. Born in New York, NY, Beck studied at the SUNY College in Purchase, NY, from 1980 to 1984. He then attended Columbia University in New York to study film, French language, and culture from 1982 to 1983.,
,
The photographer has held several solo exhibitions in many institutions around the world, including Sonnabend Gallery in New York, NY; Metropolis in Lyon, France; Karyn Lovegrove Gallery in Los Angeles, CA; Galerie Rodolfe Janssen in Brussels, Belgium; Seomi Gallery in Seoul, Korea; and Projex Mtl Galerie in Montreal, Canada. He has participated in group exhibitions, such as Art Basel in Switzerland, Brussels Art Fair, Cologne Art Fair, and Paris Photo.,
,
Beck currently lives and works in New York, NY. ,

48 inch Custom Desk,
Industrial Wood Metal Pipe Desk,
With built in lamp,
,
Hi! I purchased this desk on Etsy as a custom listing for $750 ... it has the perfect vintage, industrial, pipe legs look that I was going for! I was really happy with the purchase but after putting it together I realized it was a few inches too short of the space I wanted to place it... and now I can't use it as I need to order one about 6 inches bigger!!! I'm Looking to get close to what I paid for it... but I am flexible... cash and carry or I can drop off if you are located close by...,

This is a brand new first edition book by Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. It is a fictional book set in Japan in 1903 about ""love, greed and violence reminiscent of a Kurosawa film."",
,
It's copyright is 1996, after Libby left the White House.,
,
From 2001 to 2005 Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was the Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as being Cheney's Assistant for National Security Affairs and Assistant to President George W. Bush. ,
,
He came to the attention of the world when he was criminally indicted (he pleaded not guilty) and convicted of leaking the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plane Wilson (see CNN news screen grab in photos). His conviction covered four counts: One count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements. His appeal failed and President George W. Bush commuted his sentence.,
,
*As of April 13, 2018 he was fully pardoned by President Donald J. Trump.,
,
This book is in brand new condition with a heavy plastic clear dust jacket that came on it from the publisher. ,
I purchased this book upon its release in 1996 and kept it safely stored.,

Very good condition.  Comes with manual.  Uses ceramic stones to sharpen knives and carbide bits to maintain a (regular and serrated) knife's edge. Nothing wrong with it.  I've decided to get my knives professionally sharpened instead.  ,

These are 5 historical items for any collector of political memorabilia. The two glasses are important souvenirs of the last international trip President Richard Nixon took before he resigned on August 8, 1974. Unused. You will never again see these items, outside of a museum.,
,
*** I have added two mugs. One from Camp David and the other from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchel. Both have been used and the Mitchell mug has been repaired (see photo closeup).,
,
The Bill Clinton M&Ms were given out at the White House Mess for people who worked in the White House and their guests. They were a replacement for the cigarettes that used to be given out before it was no longer seen as healthy to be smoking. ,
,
The glasses read in gold: ""President Richard Nixon's Visit To Belgium and the Soviet Union June - July 1974"" ,
On the back of the glasses is a stylized picture of the White House in white and gold.,
,
These were given out as a courtesy to the press on the White House Press plane that accompanied President Nixon on international trips. A friend of mine who covered the Richard Nixon White House gave these to me years ago.,

Rare. Highly collectible.,
,
On July 4, 1986, I attended ""Liberty Weekend"" the commemoration activities for the Statue of Liberty's 100th Anniversary in New York Harbor.,
,
It was ""The Biggest Party Ever"" quoted the New York Times. ""America celebrated itself this weekend in a style which, whether deemed appropriately grand or embarassingly excessive, was undeniably stunning. With President Reagan leading the cheers, millions of spectators ringed New York harbor on the Fourth of July for the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty."" (See the last photo of President Reagan, with Nancy, giving his address at Liberty Weekend). ,
It was also the unveiling of the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty.,
,
This booklet was given to the attendees of which I was one. If you are a stamp collector it contains two very important commemorative stamps.,
,
It has all the information needed to enjoy the events of that exciting day. Including:,
The arrival of François Mitterrand the President of France; remarks by Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole; remarks by Lee Iacocoa Chairman Statue of liberty-Ellis Island Foundation; Emil Mosbacher, Jr. Chairman of Operation Sail; and President Ronald Reagan's address to the nation.,
,

Rare. Highly collectible.,
,
On July 4, 1986, I attended ""Liberty Weekend"" the commemoration activities for the Statue of Liberty's 100th Anniversary in New York Harbor.,
,
It was ""The Biggest Party Ever"" quoted the New York Times. ""America celebrated itself this weekend in a style which, whether deemed appropriately grand or embarassingly excessive, was undeniably stunning. With President Reagan leading the cheers, millions of spectators ringed New York harbor on the Fourth of July for the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty."" (See the last photo of President Reagan, with Nancy, giving his address at Liberty Weekend). ,
It was also the unveiling of the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty.,
,
This booklet was given to the attendees of which I was one. If you are a stamp collector it contains two very important commemorative stamps.,
,
It has all the information needed to enjoy the events of that exciting day. Including:,
The arrival of François Mitterrand the President of France; remarks by Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole; remarks by Lee Iacocoa Chairman Statue of liberty-Ellis Island Foundation; Emil Mosbacher, Jr. Chairman of Operation Sail; and President Ronald Reagan's address to the nation.,
,

This is a brand new first edition book by Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. It is a fictional book set in Japan in 1903 about ""love, greed and violence reminiscent of a Kurosawa film."",
,
It's copyright is 1996, after Libby left the White House.,
,
From 2001 to 2005 Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was the Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as being Cheney's Assistant for National Security Affairs and Assistant to President George W. Bush. ,
,
He came to the attention of the world when he was criminally indicted (he pleaded not guilty) and convicted of leaking the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plane Wilson (see CNN news screen grab in photos). His conviction covered four counts: One count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements. His appeal failed and President George W. Bush commuted his sentence.,
,
*As of April 13, 2018 he was fully pardoned by President Donald J. Trump.,
,
This book is in brand new condition with a heavy plastic clear dust jacket that came on it from the publisher. ,
I purchased this book upon its release in 1996 and kept it safely stored.,

For serious consideration, is a 1976 AMF Shovelhead Harley-Davidson FXE (Super Glide - Electric Start) built in Bobber style.  Bike has all new tins, undercoated, painted in a bright red and hand laid 22k Gold Leaf, all under a thick layer of chemical resistant 2K clear coat. Tank was lined with RedKote to prevent rusting.  Bike has a chromed Wide Glide 21"" laced front end, 130-16"" rear laced wheel/tire, custom Loud-As-Fuck ""Y"" pipes, S&S Super E carb, Baker 6-into-4 tranny with kickstart (6 speed) , wet/dry variable pressure clutch, Progressive 430 shocks, custom lighting and new wiring from handlebar switches down to taillights.,
,
The bike is 42 years old, and it runs like a 42 y.o. bike would; it is currently registered and insured as a Historical Vehicle, so insurance is dirt cheap with Hagerty.  ,
,
I have been asked about the VIN; the answer is YES, it is a numbers-matching frame and engine (only the tranny has been replaced to upgrade to a 6-speed tranny).,
,
This bike sounds as amazing as it looks; it literally turns heads.,
,
Can be seen in person during evening hours, by appointment only. Price is negotiable and trades will be considered. Would be interested in a Nightster, XL1200T, or an NA Miata...

Adirondack Guide Boat -- Traditional 16-Foot -- Master Built,
,
Handbuilt by Joe Rector, an Adirondack native who learned the craft from the area's masters, this stunning Guide Boat was used for display only. It was commissioned by an outdoorsman who appreciated its beauty and the craftsmanship involved, not, necessarily, for boating.,
,
Rector made just 10 of these special boats. He says, ""That 1987 boat was my second build. It's a true traditional Adirondack Guide Boat built no differently than the originals at the turn of the century (1880-1910). I used Tamarack for the ribs, and quarter-sawn pine for planking. The seats and gunwales are cherry. I built it when it was 24 years old, during the winter of 1986-87."",
,
Having spent its life indoors, mostly hanging from a ceiling, today, this boat is in excellent condition. It's available for viewing in Suffern, New York, 30 miles northwest of Manhattan. Delivery can be arranged. Asking price: $5500. Reasonable offers will be considered.,
,
ABOUT THE BUILDER,
Joseph Rector has written for Adirondack Life magazine and is an internationally published landscape photographer. He spends his free time climbing and re-climbing the Adirondack high peaks that he loves. ,
,
IN HIS OWN WORDS,
""I fell head over heels with the traditionally built Adirondack guide boat as a teenager on my first of many visits to the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake. It didn't take long before I was trudging through the woods with forty pounds of hand tools and a chainsaw in search of Tamarack and Spruce root stock and giant limbless Pine trees. ,
,
""At age 18 I took the $400.00 graduation money that my father gave me and purchased a very beat up 80 year old guide boat from Gabriels, NY. It was a no-name, wreck of a boat that probably should have been made into bookshelves. My dad was less than pleased with the purchase, actually quite angry. I spent a year restoring the boat and eventually sold the antique for $2050.00. ,
,
""I then purchased tools and set up shop and fully immersed myself in Kenneth Durant's book, The Adirondack Guide-boat. I also spent many hours visiting and pestering the old Master builders, Harold Austin of Long Lake and Ralph Morrow and Carl Hathaway of Saranac Lake. There was also a handful of younger builders in the 1980's and we helped each other along trading ideas and secrets. But all in all, Carl Hathaway had the most patience with a determined teenager. I would pop into his shop with a new building dilemma every few weeks and he would take me to the bench and patiently show me what Willard Hanmer had passed along to him. He taught me the most difficult aspect of building a traditional boat--the hollowing and rounding of the quartersawn pine planking to make the planks fit like bark to a tree--no bending, no steaming, just a natural handhewn fit. On every visit I felt like I stepped back in time and I knew in my young heart that I was learning something very special. I felt very privileged and very lucky to be learning this fading artform from the remaining Master builders.,
,
""Over the the years, starting in 1985, I built 10 guide boats in the 14- to 16-foot range. There is no telltale ""Rector"" guide boat. I started with a Grant design and modified it many times. My last two boats were true Elbridge Ricketson designs, and if I build in the future I will build that boat again. All my boats are stamped with my name and the year they were built on the foot of the inside stem piece."",
,
ABOUT ADIRONDACK GUIDEBOATS,
Elegant of line and born of requirement, built for 19th century Adirondack guide and gentry alike, defined by more than 100 years of speed, stealth and stability, an American classic returns.,
,
The Adirondack Guideboat influenced commerce, culture and developed rowing sport in Lake Region of New York's Adirondack Mountains. The boat was built with local pine, spruce and cedar and 8,000 tiny tacks and screws. Guideboats flourished for perhaps 60 years with a peak perhaps in the 1880s and 1890s. With the advent of the automobile and access roads, the Guideboat was no longer needed for regional transportation. But the design of the boat was held in high esteem and the Guideboat found a new position in recreational rowing.,
,
FURTHER HISTORY,
Prior to summering in the Hamptons or Tahoe became chic, the late 1800's witnessed Adirondack Guideboats ferrying the likes of Morgan, Rockefeller and Post to their captain of industry Adirondack camps, deep woods lakeside retreats, each grander than the other. Without road let alone path but graced with endless and pristine lakes, the way in was by Guideboat.

The MXR M169 Carbon Copy Analog Delay is a contemporary delay pedal with roots deeply planted in the classic tape echo tones of the past. While it may lack the elaborate controls of some digital modelers, it more than makes up for it in its tried-and-true bucket brigade-driven analog tone. For players looking to get their feet wet with delay, the Carbon Copy has served as an easy choice for years, earning its spot in the pantheon of modern pedalboard standards.,

These are 5 historical items for any collector of political memorabilia. The two glasses are important souvenirs of the last international trip President Richard Nixon took before he resigned on August 8, 1974. Unused. You will never again see these items, outside of a museum.,
,
*** I have added two mugs. One from Camp David and the other from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchel. Both have been used and the Mitchell mug has been repaired (see photo closeup).,
,
The Bill Clinton M&Ms were given out at the White House Mess for people who worked in the White House and their guests. They were a replacement for the cigarettes that used to be given out before it was no longer seen as healthy to be smoking. ,
,
The glasses read in gold: ""President Richard Nixon's Visit To Belgium and the Soviet Union June - July 1974"" ,
On the back of the glasses is a stylized picture of the White House in white and gold.,
,
These were given out as a courtesy to the press on the White House Press plane that accompanied President Nixon on international trips. A friend of mine who covered the Richard Nixon White House gave these to me years ago.,

Three drawer chest made by Drexel and comes with a glass top that was cut specifically for this piece of furniture.  The imagery on the chest has a raise finish.   The dimensions are:  40"" wide x 31"" high x 19 1/2"" deep.  Circa 1975. Mirror dimensions are about 4' high x 18"" wide.,
I'd estimate this to be from about 1975, both in excellent condition.,
Asking $600 for both,

John Lennon lithograph, approximately 36x24 in a professional frame, numbered.

A folding acoustical divider that dampens sound as it separates space. Each partition panel uses a fully-tackable, acoustical ribbed fabric over a heavy foam core. Set up the VersiFold in a zig-zag pattern, or combine with the VersiFoot accessories to create either ""L"" or ""C"" shapes. Each unit has side magnets that allow multiple VersiFolds or VersiPanels to be interconnected. ,
,
Quickly and easily create additional office work areas, home recording studios, portable classrooms, and temporary meeting areas. Even if space division isn't a priority, these partitions may be placed against walls to add accent while controlling acoustics. Several units may be linked together with the built-in magnetic end pieces. Use the VersiFold as an acoustical studio partition, or as a school room divider to manage space more effectively.,
,
Fully extended it is 96"" long, and 78"" high.  It folds neatly into four panels.  It weighs about 20 lbs, you could easily take it on the subway if a friend helps carry it.  ,
,
It has some scratch marks on it from a cat on one of the panels, but otherwise it's in great shape.  ,

This is such a cool item and almost belongs in a museum. You can really step back in time when you look at this mechanic's creeper and it's wood slat and nail construction. Complete with hanging wire and looks really nice on a wall. Measures 42"" tall by 25.5"" wide and 4"" deep including casters.

I bought this from Union Garage in Brooklyn a few seasons ago, it's in great shape.  Similar to a Belstaff or Barbour jacket but for hundreds less.  Comes with removable armor in the elbow and shoulder pads.  ,
,
It's a large and a great riding jacket, but also very warm(my warmest jacket), so doubles up as a winter jacket.  I've just washed the inner lining. ,
,
I live in Brooklyn and work in midtown and can meet in either location.  Would make a great Christmas present.,

Hand-painted lacquer cabinet, imported in the mid 70s. From across the room you will notice this piece is far superior to the reproductions you commonly see today. The colors are brilliant and the brush strokes, intricacy of design and overall workmanship are very impressive. This piece truly stands out and gives a room an authentic air of exotic taste. If you enjoy Oriental design, you will not be disappointed with this wonderful piece and it will compliment it's surroundings nicely. ,

NordicTrack C2255 Treadmill. Needs to be repaired. It's been an awesome treadmill and has built in impact reduction. I have replaced deck and belt over the years and it was running great until the belt recently began slipping. I can't figure out the problem and it may be motor or electrical or other but either way beyond my mechanical expertise. Free to whoever wants to pick it up. Heavy so we will need to take some pieces off to get out of the house or bring a hand truck with you.

These are Cole Haan men's shoes size 12 B (narrow) Brown. The shoes have been conditioned with a rubber half sole and heel for protection (This was done immediately upon purchase so there are no hidden scuffs). These are in excellent condition and I truthfully never wore these outdoors because they were just too narrow for me. They have been in individial shoe bags with  cedarwood shoe trees. ,

For sale is the wild and crazy Organelle from Critter and Guitari. I lusted after one of these for years and only recently acquired one. Its every bit as cool as I dreamed it would be. It does so many whacky fun things that I can't even really explain it. It can be anything be it a synth, a sampler, a drum machine or an effects box. Comes with Box and Power Supply - $450 is my price. Cash PayPal or Venmo only. ,

   I live in Yonkers but can meet anywhere in the NYC area. My band has a rehearsal space in Greenpoint Brooklyn where I can meet up as well. Please message me for pics and/ or questions. Thanks!

Whether your driving by or live in the neighborhood this is the place where everybody knows your name. What a great location with an even better atmosphere inside. This Bar / Pub / Restaurant is very well maintained and is ready for an experienced operator or a first time buyer to come in and continue to grow this turn key operation. Building up lunch , catering , Advertising & Deliveries are just some ways to boost sales and profit. With a full 4am liquor license and a C/O of 80+ , current owner cannot take advantage of the huge potential this location has to offer due to personal matters. Recently renovated and all equipment in great working condition and a fully trained staff in place this is will be an easy transition. Live music , Happy Hour , Great Food & Drink specials. Too Much too list!! All sales verifiable through P.O.S.,

Hey, I have an older 21"" Snapper Hi-Vac Mower that I haven't used in years because I have a landscaper. It's an older model (The good one) with the good wheels and none of that pesky safety stuff!!! It's a rear bagger (Bag Included) with the Briggs and Stratton engine. It works well. I actually used it once this past summer when the landscaper didn't show up! The only picture I have is with it buried in the shed, but I'm sure you know what a lawn mower looks like!!! I'm asking 50 bucks, and if you come and get it soon, I'll throw in a gas powered blower! FREE!!! Can't beat that!!! Call or text me at  ,

Current owner who is moving is forced to sell this diamond in the rough Pizzeria. Located in the East Village of NYC sits this well known to the area Pizzeria & only does Walk in and Deliveries. The split is 60% walk in & 40% deliveries. Huge residential area with 4 new apartment complexes being added at this moment. The landlord is also renovating the face of this location and putting $1M into his building.  This location can be taken to the next level by building up lunch , social media , Extending hrs & building up the huge delivery service this area has to offer. Because this is being ran absentee a new owner operator or semi hands on operator can come in & relieve some of the payroll and increase your net instantly. All equipment in working condition. Very low rent with a favorable lease for this area. Nothing but great things are going to happen at this location. Must See!!,

Hi, up for sale is the Korg 1600 Mk II Digital Studio Recorder. I had purchased this item, hoping I would make time to use it. It is in Pristine Mint condition and has never been used. It's been in my studio covered up (to keep elements away). I have decided to sell it, hoping there is someone else that may have need for it. I am the original owner and had paid $1,200.00 for this unit and decided to sell it for this fair price. Comes complete without original box. This is a magnificent unit that includes: touchscreen and a Disc Drive. Look at pics and research on the web,

2000 Ferrari 360 Modena Manual 6 speed fear box ,
,
RMC Miami is now offering for your consideration this gorgeous Ferrari 360 Modena.,
,
This beautiful 360 Modena is the perfect optioned car for a Ferrari enthusiast. The Gated manual is the most sought after of these,
mid 90's to mid 2000's Ferrari's. The rare silver exterior is in nice condition overall has a clear bra on front fascia which has helped against ,
many rock chips though there are a couple above the clear bra. Passenger door has a scratch but was left alone to keep originality.,
,
Car has never been in any accident or had any type of body repaid and has a clean car fax.Exterior is complimented nicely by the challenge grill ,
which if you look closely shows the gorgeous Capristo exhaust behind it. Factory wheels are in good overall condition with little to no curb ,
rash and are straight without any bends or cracks. All four tires have plenty of tire tread depth left and are matching BF Goodrich brand.,
,
Interior wise this Ferrari has held up the test of time. The seats show minimal wear and have not been touched up in anyway. The bolsters,
are in good condition and firm which is exactly how they should be to keep you planted in your seat at all times. Door panels are really nice,,
both windows work well. The door handles do have minor scratches as expected. The Air conditioning is ice cold and blows hard.,
Some sticky buttons are there but not all are sticky. Dashboard is very nice, not warped or deformed in any way. Original radio works,
well and the sound system sounds great, speakers aren't blown and sound clear. ,
,
Engine just had a major service in August of this year at 44,991 Miles which included timing belt, cambelt tensioners, cam gaskets, spark plugs,,
and all new shifter bushings. Needless to say our Ferrari is as turn key as they come. The car drives perfect there is no check engine lights on,
and the car pulls really hard in every gear as it packs 400 Horsepower. Clutch is in good condition and the Gated gear box is like butter, ,
probably the best feeling gearbox of any Ferrari. The Exhaust system has been upgraded to a $5,000 Capristo free flow exhaust system which,
gives it that great deep tone and beautiful exhaust note while revving to 8,000 Rpms.. ,

Everything in good working condition. Belt was recently replaced. Could use a new needle. The only real issue is that the balance and tracking need some TLC. Despite my attempts at calibrating the arm, it will often have a hard time staying down when starting to play a record. Once it gets going, it doesn't pop back up until the record is finished, but it usually takes a couple of tries to get going at first start. This is a great opportunity for someone who knows how to work on vinyl record players, or someone who wants a great deal and doesn't mind a slight inconvenience. ,

This is a brand new and unlocked Galaxy s9 with 64GB of internal storage memory.  I won this phone as a part of a company raffle but have absolutely no use for it since I own a brand new iPhone XS.

Everything in good working condition. Belt was recently replaced. Could use a new needle. The only real issue is that the balance and tracking need some TLC. Despite my attempts at calibrating the arm, it will often have a hard time staying down when starting to play a record. Once it gets going, it doesn't pop back up until the record is finished, but it usually takes a couple of tries to get going at first start. This is a great opportunity for someone who knows how to work on vinyl record players, or someone who wants a great deal and doesn't mind a slight inconvenience. ,

I can also deliver to you within NYC for a reasonable and negotiable fee.,

Hi, up for sale are a pair of Sony SS-F5000 floor speakers -,
,
The Sony SS-F5000 can fill any room in your house with crystal-clear treble and deep bass tones.,
,
These floor-standing speakers are specially designed to reproduce rich and vibrant tones that cover the complete range of possibilities.,
,
The 3 1/4-inch enhanced cone mid driver pushes bass to its limits without compromising quality.,
,
The 1-inch Nano Fine balanced dome tweeter recreates high-resolution audio, even at the 150-watt maximum input lower level.,
A sensitive ear will appreciate being able to hear every instrument in an orchestra.,
,
Whether you are a composer, arranger, or musician, you may be impressed with the crisp, clear sound these speakers provide at all dynamic ranges.,
,
The tall columns are designed in a minimalist style allowing these accessories to blend into many environments.,
,
Pearly white cloth grilles stand out and lend a touch of elegance to the design.,
,
These grilles can also be detached for cleaning.,
,
The sleek black finish is understated yet stylish.,
,
Each Sony speaker is made with real wood, a light yet strong type of material. In addition to quality reverberation, the wood construction lends sturdiness to the product.,
,
An 8-inch Kevlar woofer is mica-reinforced for strength and durability.,
,
The Kevlar cones stand up to as much noise as you can throw at them. The magnetically shielded electronics design provides extra security.,
,
Each speaker is 14.3 inches long, 9.4 inches wide, and 33.5 inches tall, making it possible for these accessories to be tucked into any corner of a room.,
,
Weighing in at around 24 pounds, the floor-standing SS-F5000 speakers are sturdy enough to stand up by themselves.,
,
Despite the ability to produce floor-shaking sounds, they will remain steady. They are lightweight enough to move around to adjust the placement.,
,
You can also place them on a bookshelf, an end table, or the floor, giving them flexibility in different systems.,
,
A hard, flat floor provides a good surface for the speakers to stand on, both for sturdiness and for reverberation. ,
,
It is recommended to place the pair of towers in similar acoustic environments. Putting the speakers and the listener in an equilateral triangle allows for a particularly enjoyable listening experience.,
,
The Sony SS-F5000 model has a lot to offer your home theater.,
,
With 3-way bass reflex, they can surround your theater in deep and powerful sound.,
,
Since they have standard wire ports, these Sony speakers are compatible with several different connector cables. You can hook them to amplifiers or subwoofers to use them as part of your acoustic system, or you can use them as they are without any other equipment and accessories.,
,
The volume will be excellent and the audio quality will remain fresh and undistorted.,
,
Whether you're watching your favorite TV shows and Blu-ray movies, listening to tunes, or playing video games, these speakers continue to provide powerful sound for all of your content.,
,
The passive amplification stereo provides quality without compromise.,
,
The product has a sensitivity of 88 db. A subtlety of range is the result, so you can enjoy all kinds and genres of music as it was meant to be heard.,
,
The SS-F5000 has a 45 Hz to 50 kHz frequency response, so all you hear is high-precision audio. Because the high tweeters are near ear level, the sound comes straight to you.,

Being ran 100% absentee this homerun neighborhood Deli has so much more potential for someone to come in and take it to the next level. Current owner does not take advantage of the huge delivery , large amounts of catering and local school and sports events that go on in this area. Located on a Main rd leading to a huge south shore residential area with local beaches , boat marinas , town docks , ferries & so much more. Situated in a very well groomed area and is the only show around. This deli has the area locked up. Current owner is ready to retire from all of his locations and move on. He will entertain all offers and will finance with the right offer. ,

Very cool, working (provided you have an analog adapter) vintage Sony CRT television. Great for an installation, art project, or just for cool decor. ,
,
Very good condition for its age. Carrying handle works. I used it for an art installation where I fed in a signal from a computer and converted it to analog and it worked! ,
,
Iconic Sony TV that was used widely with the Apple I computers of 1976 and can be seen in several museum displays of the Apple I ! It is a Sony TV-115!,

Snell Type A/II,
Walnut Finish,
Excellent condition, both mechanically and cosmetically from non-smoking, air-conditioned home. I haven't had the room to enjoy these for almost 27 years so they've remained covered. The Snell Type A is still my favorite speaker of all time. I preferred the Type A/II over the later A/III and IIIi. They were too clinical to me. This was the most musical and was easier to integrate into a room. While these are fairly large speakers, the great thing about them is that they come in two halves, none of which are over 50 pounds. Try moving a pair of the Snell Type B or even the C speakers. Many hookup possibilities: standard stereo, bi-wire, vertical or horizontal passive or active bi-amping. Yes, I'm including the electronic crossover as well. These can take a lot of power but don't need a lot. They sounded great with just a single Apt Holman amp though I used 2 of them once I started bi-amping them using the crossover. I'll cry when I see them go but I'm realizing it'll be another 6 years before I'm likely to move again. Oh, the woofer surrounds are fine. I actually had them done by Snell when they were still in business. Note: I am not a stereo store and have no room to really demonstrate the capabilities. You should already be aware of them and know that you want these. I can hook them up to briefly verify function. You'll have to carry them downstairs yourself though I'll get the doors for you. :-)    ",,Snell Type A/II [Walnut Finish] w/ Electronic Crossover,Snell,2018-12-17 10:42,Snell,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/d/snell-type-ii-walnut-finish/6774623312.html

Do you have a VHS tape that you'd like to have a digital copy of so you can view it on your computer, phone, or tablet? I can do that for you. I can convert as many VHS tapes as you want to put on a flash drive or SD card. Once you have it, you can even then burn it to DVD or BluRay. ,
,
I charge $10 per VHS tape that's converted. You can either bring the VHS tape(s) to me to convert or send it by mail as long as you cover return shipping. If you do want it by mail, be sure to include a flash drive or SD card that has at least 6GB of free space. ,
,
Also, how would you like to get this service at a discounted price or possibly for free? There are some apps you can install using my referral code that will give you money. You can use that money to pay for the service if you want and still have money left over! Or you can use that money to buy something else you want!,
,
Send me a text message if you want to convert a VHS tape. Or, Send me an email if you want to get my referral code to install apps and get the free money. You need either an Android phone or an iPhone to install the apps. Blackberry and Windows phones aren't supported unfortunately.

Location, this is as good of a location that one can own. Located in Brooklyn this is one of the busiest walking traffic blocks one can wish to own a store on. This store is in business for 17 years with the same owner and sales are a constant 100k a week. Incredible to say their grocery end is not something they specialize in and there is no produce being sold at all, which means their upside in this store is huge. All sales are 100% verifiable and so is the net. I could write more, but for someone in the business or even looking to enter the Supermarket business this one just screams success and Verifiable Profit.

Newly Renovated Deli and Grocery store in the country club section of the Bronx that does ATLEAST 16k a week WITHOUT Lotto. An involved owner operator that adds lotto can easily take this store to 25K a week in the first year of ownership. This 1,800 Sf space is very close to Pelham Bay Park and many residential homes. The owner just added beer and cigarettes and saw an instant 10% increase in his sales, within the first two weeks, which is not factored into the listed cash flow of 160K a year.  The owner is willing to finance up to 20% of the deal. ,

What an opportunity for someone to come in and take over these turn key , very well established , state of the art, 2 great location Yoga studios. These financials reflect 2 locations combined. First location has been running for 8 years and is the moneymaker. The second location is only 6 months old and has cut into the net at this point , but after building up the second location which is in a very well groomed area , you will increase the sales and net drastically. For the past 8 years the current owner has done everything right and has spared no expense in building up these unbelievable studios. With over 400 members and a fully trained teaching staff plus the current owner who is willing to stay on and teach makes this an easy transition for a buyer with or without yoga experience. Both studios are newly painted with full surround sound systems with built in speakers. All members sign in on a wall mounted IPAD to make it easy & quick for sign ups and keeping track of clientele. Brand new website with professional pictures & updated SEO. Yoga studio has its own Custom APP. Sales & display racks fully stocked with all updated equipment & apparel. Yoga rooms equipped with steam humidification system , ecobee thermostats , Showers , Changing rooms , coat rooms , lobby with fireplace & so much more. Due to her growing family the current owner cannot keep up with the still growing Yoga empire that she has worked so hard at and brought this mom & pop shop to the highest level of Yoga Studios. Please serious inquiries.,

What an opportunity for someone to come in and take over these turn key , very well established , state of the art, 2 great location Yoga studios. These financials reflect 2 locations combined. First location has been running for 8 years and is the moneymaker. The second location is only 6 months old and has cut into the net at this point , but after building up the second location which is in a very well groomed area , you will increase the sales and net drastically. For the past 8 years the current owner has done everything right and has spared no expense in building up these unbelievable studios. With over 400 members and a fully trained teaching staff plus the current owner who is willing to stay on and teach makes this an easy transition for a buyer with or without yoga experience. Both studios are newly painted with full surround sound systems with built in speakers. All members sign in on a wall mounted IPAD to make it easy & quick for sign ups and keeping track of clientele. Brand new website with professional pictures & updated SEO. Yoga studio has its own Custom APP. Sales & display racks fully stocked with all updated equipment & apparel. Yoga rooms equipped with steam humidification system , ecobee thermostats , Showers , Changing rooms , coat rooms , lobby with fireplace & so much more. Due to her growing family the current owner cannot keep up with the still growing Yoga empire that she has worked so hard at and brought this mom & pop shop to the highest level of Yoga Studios. Please serious inquiries.,

For sale is a DeSite SLG 78VF Topsoil Screener.  The DeSite SLG 78VF is our midsize portable vibratory screener, designed to be fed with skid steers, bucket tractors, mid size excavators and compact loaders. The SLG 78VF will produce 15 to 30 yards per hour depending upon mesh, material being screened, and the type and size of machine feeding the screener.  The screener deck can adjust from 30 degrees to 45 degrees allowing you to screen not only gravel and sand, but also high moisture materials.  Multiple mesh sizes are available from ⅛ to 4 inches for screening sand, soil, compost, rock, and woody debris.The feed deflector on the 78VF allows the operator to feed the screener faster and more aggressively. The feed deflector mounts into quick disconnect lugs that allow the feeder to tip forward and let the oversize material pass over the screen deck and into the other pile. When screening very trashy material with lots of oversize stumps, big roots and construction debris, the feeder can be completely removed turning the screener into a standard deck screen.  The cantilevered suspension system allows the screen deck to pivot from 45 degrees for high moisture material all the way back to 30 degrees for sand and soils with low moisture, giving the operator maximum control over the screening process.  The SLG 78VF can be moved easily around the work site using your pallet forks or with your machines bucket using the bucket transport lugs, sold separately.  The screeners can be fed efficiently from the front, back and from either side. The SLG 78VF can be fed with buckets up to 78 inches wide from the back or front. When  feeding the screener from the side with a compact excavator you can use up to a 36 inch wide bucket. The SLG 78VF can be ran with a small compact 3500 watt generator.   The SLG 78VF has been designed to load lengthwise or crosswise on the trailer leaving room for your skid steer or compact excavator. We also sell a SLG-68V which is a smaller screener, and a SLG-108VFRB which is a bigger screener.  Please feel free to contact us for a live demonstration and any questions you may have.         ,

This is a new bumper kit for the first Volvo P1800 Coupe models produced by Jensen from 1961-63. The kit consists of 2 front cow horn bumpers, 2 rear bumpers, and 2 nose trim pieces. Stainless steel was chosen for the following reasons:,
,
1) never corrodes(rust proof); grade 304/1,4301/7,
,
2) in case of dent or damage unlike chrome plated steel it does not require stripping and re-chroming,
,
3) stainless steel allows for easy repair and re-polishing in the hand of a professional,
,
4) it's a lot tougher than chrome plated steel bumpers The bumpers are finished to a high mirror polish, just like chrome. The back of bumpers are acid etch primed and painted with ICI two pack paint in a cream tone.,

Delivery takes 2-3 weeks. ,

Do you need a High Risk Merchant Account? Is your business having trouble getting approved for traditional merchant service accounts? We offers a full suite of electronic payment solutions for all business types, including high risk merchant service needs.,
,
,
High risk merchants are businesses which fall outside of conventional categories and have an increased risk of fraud, a high turnover rate, or a high credit rate. These businesses typically find difficulty being approved for credit card processing and are often declined when applying for merchant service accounts. The presumptuous connotations associated with the ""High Risk Merchant"" label makes it challenging for many honest, hardworking merchants to process credit cards transactions; resulting in reduced popularity, customers, sales and ultimately, revenue. We understand that accepting electronic payments is critical for survival to high risk merchants, as it is for every other business. With our philosophy of ""the customer comes first,"" we have a solution that is right for you.,
,
For more information and to get started please give us a call @  ,

- Men's Size 9D (medium),

This phone is practically NEW.  It went from AT&T store, set forwarding to my other work cell phone number, turn phone off and into my desk drawer.  For the past 2+ years I think I may have turned it on and recharged it no more than 4 or 5 times TOTAL... so the battery should be in great condition.,

It is totally working because I just brought it to AT&T store yesterday and have them transfer and upgrade my line to iPhone.,

I'm selling my Super Split log splitter.,
I've reached a point where I no longer split and stack my own wood, so I no longer need it.,
This splitter is like no other you've seen. There is no comparison for speed with hydraulic splitters. If you've never seen one of these in use, go to:,
http://www.supersplit.com/videos_oper/index.html,
on the Super Split website. It's exactly as fast as it appears to be in their video.,
Has a Honda motor- incredibly reliable.,
The one I have in not towable.,
Asking $1500,
If interested, call and leave me your name and number, I'll call you back.    ",,Super Split Log Splitter,,2018-12-17 11:34,,https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/tls/d/super-split-log-splitter/6772545280.html

Location, this is as good of a location that one can own. Located in Brooklyn this is one of the busiest walking traffic blocks one can wish to own a store on. This store is in business for 17 years with the same owner and sales are a constant 100k a week. Incredible to say their grocery end is not something they specialize in and there is no produce being sold at all, which means their upside in this store is huge. All sales are 100% verifiable and so is the net. I could write more, but for someone in the business or even looking to enter the Supermarket business this one just screams success and Verifiable Profit.,

We bought this car from a dealer in New Jersey last year for 21k. We absolutely love it but we're leaving the US at Christmas. MUST SELL FAST SO WILL NEGOTIATE.,
,
It had one previous owner who put 35k miles on it, mostly freeway driving. We bought it in excellent condition. After a year as a busy family car in Brooklyn, it has some scrapes and bruises inside and out.,
,
7 seats, so tons of room, but still shorter than most SUVs so great for parking in NYC, especially as there's a backup camera included. We've often driven to the beach with 3 adults and 4 kids and plenty of beach gear, no problem. Other extras: moonroof, bluetooth handsfree phone system, 6-cd + AUX sound system. ,
,
Again time is of the essence for me so get in touch!,
,
Specs from cars.com:,
,

The Tribeca comes with all-wheel drive and seats seven with a standard third row. It competes with other midsize crossovers like the Ford Explorer, Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander. It's the only three-row model in Subaru's lineup.,
New for 2013,
The 2013 Tribeca gets a brake override system but there are no other significant changes.,

But, if you're looking at this, you probably know what it is.,
included are manual, charger, battery, international plugs, and the tuning device, which weighs practically nothing, and is invisible from the front or sides. ,
it doesn't scratch or mark up your guitar in any way. it comes off when you change strings.

Hey, I have an older 21"" Snapper Hi-Vac Mower that I haven't used in years because I have a landscaper. It's an older model (The good one) with the good wheels and none of that pesky safety stuff!!! It's a rear bagger (Bag Included) with the Briggs and Stratton engine. It works well. I actually used it once this past summer when the landscaper didn't show up! The only picture I have is with buried in the shed, but I'm sure you know what a lawn mower looks like!!! I'm asking 50 bucks, and if you come and get it soon, I'll throw in a gas powered blower!

This hand carved teak wood masterpiece was purchased from a dealer on Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok in 2009, imported to the US, and has been hanging on my living room wall since.,
,
The carving is made from a single section of a teak tree that I'm told was several hundred years old at the time it was cut, which seems completely plausible given the size of the trunk.  The detail is something that must be seen in person to truly appreciate.  It's easy to get lost for 15-20 minutes just letting your eyes wander across the dragons' faces and bodies, appreciating the patience it must have taken to produce something so intricate.  Anyone that has visited the house has made remarks and usually asked to take a picture.,
,
Measurements for the carving run roughly 5'Hx4'Wx2'D.  It is hollow, meaning the negative space seen is actually open to the wall behind it.  I'm unsure of the exact weight, but it is relatively light given it's overall size.  I'd say it's no more than 20-25 lbs.,
,
Local pickup is preferred; however, shipping can be arranged.  A proper shipping company should likely be used as a wood crate should be custom built for protection due to the delicate nature of the carving.  Shipping weight might be 100lbs or more when accounting for a wood crate large enough to accommodate this piece.,

You may want to reach out and touch this piece of crumbled paper! One can't believe that it's not three dimensional. ,
,
The talent of Daniel Adel  as an American artist is exhibited by how he creates such three dimensionality of a crumbled piece of paper on two dimensional canvas. (Read about this talented artist below and his accomplishments.) His work with light is reminiscent of Vermeer. ""Wing"" is from his earliest work before he began studying ocean waves in France and capturing them with paint.,
Daniel Adel's work is sold exclusively by a gallery that was located in SOHO until it recently relocated  to California where they still represent Mr. Adel.,
This unique and beautiful piece of art can be displayed proudly and majestically in one's home or work. It comes framed in its original solid dark wooden 4 inch deep frame which shows targets ones eyes towards the white paper.,
,
Daniel Adel has worked as a portraitist, illustrator and fine artist since 1984. His work has appeared in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and The New York Times, and on magazine covers including The New York Times Magazine, Newsweek, and Time magazine, for whom he painted two covers in 2004. His cover portrait of George W. Bush for Times's Person of the Year issue in 2004[1] is part of the collection of Washington, DC's National Portrait Gallery.[2] His portrait of the former Speaker of the New York City Council, Gifford Miller, hangs in New York's City Hall.[3]He has been commissioned to paint the Editors-in-Chief of Time, Der Spiegel, and Vanity Fair.,
Adel has exhibited his work in New York City since completing his studies in Art History at Dartmouth College. He has been represented by Arcadia Contemporary in New York City since 2001. In 2011 Oceania Cruise Lines acquired a series of eight of his major works.[4] He has received awards from the Salmagundi Club, was featured in the biennial exhibition of The National Academy of Design and was awarded three silver medals from the Society of Illustrators.,
In 2001 several of Adel's portraits appeared in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts production of ""Ten Unknowns"" by Jon Robin Baitz, starring Donald Sutherland.[5],
Adel has painted commissioned portraits for Yale University, Dartmouth College, Union Pacific Railroad, Notre Dame, The College of William and Mary, The New York Stock Exchange as well as for numerous private clients. In 2014 he painted the portrait of fashion designer Pierre Cardin.[6],
He has been a featured speaker at the Corcoran Gallery, Savannah College of Art and Design and The Rhode Island School of Design and has taught at the School of Visual Arts and The Art Student's League in New York City. In addition to portraits, the artist also known for his paintings of crumpled paper or flowing fabric against in an undefined space.[7],
He lives with his wife and two sons in the village of Lourmarin in Provence, France.,

This is an amazing and truly very rare 7-strand ZUNI fetish, American Indian, necklace. I inherited it and I believe that my relative purchased this during one of their many trips to the Southwest over many years. This was most likely purchased in New Mexico.,
,
It comes with a beautiful mother-of-pearl-inlay lacquered box. (please see photos),
,
I was told and have checked on eBay and other sites that sell Native American jewelry that it is worth around $600.,
,
The necklace is 20 inches long and has 104 hand-carved fetish animals made of turquoise, spiny oyster, gaspeite, pipestone, serpentine, and mother of pearl. ,
,
The value (as I wrote above) of these large Zuni fetish necklaces goes up in price depending upon the number of strands and fetish animals. So I have placed this at from $500 and up. The reason I am selling it for so much less is that I have identified 1 (out of 104) animals that is chipped. ,
,
It presents a very impressive piece of jewelry that everyone will notice. And can be worn with fancy evening dress...and/or jeans!,
,
$135 (cash only please and no tax) Can be available in my building's lobby on East 52nd Street most weekdays after 5:30pm with advanced notice. Sorry, no shipping.,

This is an amazing and truly very rare 7-strand ZUNI fetish, American Indian, necklace. I inherited it and I believe that my relative purchased this during one of their many trips to the Southwest over many years. This was most likely purchased in New Mexico.,
,
It comes with a beautiful mother-of-pearl-inlay lacquered box. (please see photos),
,
I was told and have checked on eBay and other sites that sell Native American jewelry that it is worth around $600.,
,
The necklace is 20 inches long and has 104 hand-carved fetish animals made of turquoise, spiny oyster, gaspeite, pipestone, serpentine, and mother of pearl. ,
,
The value (as I wrote above) of these large Zuni fetish necklaces goes up in price depending upon the number of strands and fetish animals. So I have placed this at from $500 and up. The reason I am selling it for so much less is that I have identified 1 (out of 104) animals that is chipped. ,
,
It presents a very impressive piece of jewelry that everyone will notice. And can be worn with fancy evening dress...and/or jeans!,
,
$135 (cash only please and no tax) Can be available in my building's lobby on East 52nd Street most weekdays after 5:30pm with advanced notice. Sorry, no shipping.,

This pedals sings!,
,
The Pigtronix Aria is smooth and musical. With the Aria pedal, Pigtronix takes a unique approach to diode clipping that retains the expressive nature of your music while imparting creamy sustain and enhanced harmonic content. More powerful than a modded Screamer and tastier than an old Muff, Pigtronix Aria delivers the goods, no matter how you turn the knobs.,
,
The Aria's 3-band active EQ is voiced for maximum versatility and sweetness in all settings. Exceptional as a recording tool and essential in the live rig, the Aria's 12db / octave EQs boost and cut at carefully selected frequencies, allowing you to adapt to a variety of amps or to craft entirely new, killer tones of your own.,
,
Layer the Aria with your amp's distortion or another gain pedal (PolySaturator) or a compressor (Philosopher's Tone) to create deep crunchy textures that ooze pure ROCK inspiration. This pedal will make you write new songs. Do it.,

- Sweet and Creamy Distortion for the Discerning Musician,

Hello Knicks fans! ,
,
I am a full season ticket holder and have 4 great tickets to the New York Knicks. In the third image above you can find a list of all the games I still have available. ,
,
My seats are in the newly renovated section of the Garden located in Lower Level Section 209 (center court view) Row 12 Seats 18-21. Seat 21 is an aisle seat adjacent to Section 210 making them on the closer side to center court and giving a great view (first picture above is view from seats). ,
,
3 of my 4 seats have no seat located directly in front of them (as seen in the second picture above) giving you plenty of space to maneuver and also perfectly idle for tall people who always need extra space for their legs! This also is very convenient for anyone with a handicap or families with younger children as it gives the kids plenty of room to move around and get up as much as they please! ,
,
The exit to concessions is located just a few steps down giving you easy and quick access to everything you need during a game. The bar that you see in the picture in front of my seats is lower than the view of the court from the seats so it does not block any view and makes for a great coat rack! ,
,
You may purchase either 2 or 4 of my tickets. I prefer payment through PayPal or Chase QuickPay and can forward you the tickets directly from Knicks Ticket Exchange as I am a season subscriber. If you insist on hard tickets we can schedule a face-to-face exchange. ,
,
Please let me know if you are interested. ,
,
Thanks!

This is a like-new bright red Mini Jambox from Jawbone. This is a wireless bluetooth speaker. ,
,
It was a gift, though I never wanted a bluetooth speaker. So, I only turned it on, listened to it and it does have great sound. Bottom line: I know it works fine. ,
,
It comes with it's original packaging including manual and cables.,
,
Because of its compact size, but great sound, it can easily slip into a briefcase, backpack, handbag or even some back pockets.,

This is an exquisite burl and brass buffet flawlessly achieved by Mastercraft, one of the finest American producers of the 20th century. The exceptional materiality is well met by its graceful, unusual form. There are 4 doors with sculpted brass handles. The two on the left conceal four drawers, the two on the left, an adjustable shelf. Everything is in outstanding vintage condition, pretty much perfect. A rare and beautiful piece. ,
I can bring it to you for free. I am firm on my price. ,

**Amazing Opportunity to own an established Dog Grooming Business that does very well with no marketing of new clients, and no owner present.  This Dog Grooming Business is going for 80k and is grossing on Average 275k a year doing the bare minimum and it is all turnkey ready.  The owner has other businesses and doesn't know the Grooming business nor have the time to be there.  He feels a Groomer, or bather would be ideal for buying it.  Just the accountability would have the numbers jumping plus fewer jobs to pay on, savings would add up.  4 groomers there now with a large following, 2 bathers, and front desk worker...$3200 a month rent on this lease in a great location, you can do 5 years option, 5 years flat, 10yrs (all can be worked out)... The grooming office is a nice location, with over 1000 sq feet.  When can you buy a business that the owner is so confident that he will hold the note or some of it, and you can do practically nothing and gross 275k a year on average?  we can discuss financials and location when we talk.  The database has thousands of names in it, and its been around over 7 years.  Owner feels a groomer or someone that knows the business can really take off.  Even a good business owner with time, or manager...Turnkey ready to operate and you will be glad you took the time to look into this opportunity...  So much room for growth, in every way.  Contact Mark Lanfranchi of Compass Realty Central by email or text and well arrange a time to talk...  I am not just saying this, but the owner is a really good guy and wants to see this place thrive.  Contact me today to discuss more.  The owner has no problem holding paper and letting potential serious buyer observe all they want.  Contact me now!  Something like this DOES NOT come along too often.  The owner has a way too much going on to be there and to deal with this.  If he was a groomer or bather, he said those numbers would be 3x just by having accountability over his workers, large following...Owner pay broker fee!

, ,New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure is currently seeking a project architect with 5+ years of restoration experience. , 

SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls. We take pride in being an industry leader in such practice areas as Local Law 11 inspections and repairs., 

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. ,
